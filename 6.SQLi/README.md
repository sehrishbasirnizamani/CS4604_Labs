## Objective
Understand SQL Injection and how to prevent it.

For this practice, you will need to be able to edit form fields before submitting them.
This is a basic and common technique that attackers use to test websites for vulnerabilities.

We will use the [Chrome Browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) for this lab. 
If you don't want to use Chrome, there are many alternatives. [Zap](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project) is an excellent choice. But setup and configuration of Zap (or other alternatives) are beyond the scope of this lab.

[WebGoat](https://owasp.org/www-project-webgoat/) is a deliberately insecure web application maintained by [OWASP](http://www.owasp.org/) designed to teach web application security lessons.

This program is a demonstration of common server-side application flaws. The exercises are intended to be used by people to learn about application security and penetration testing techniques.

<span style="color:red">**WARNING:exclamation:**</span> While running this program your machine will be extremely vulnerable to attack.

So <span style="color:red">**DO NOT**</span> run it using your machine, run it on [Docker Playground](http://play-with-docker.com) instead.

Go to the [Docker Playground](http://play-with-docker.com) and select `Login`

### Step1: Create a new instance

In the left-hand menu, click on `ADD NEW INSTANCE`. This will start a Docker instance (node) and log you in as the root user.

<img src="images/instance_created.png" width="500" />

### Step2: Start WebGoat
Run this command 
```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 9090:9090 webgoat/goatandwolf
```

You should see a bunch of output that ends in something like this:
```
2021-03-01 03:25:34.129  INFO 27 --- [           main] o.s.b.a.e.web.EndpointLinksResolver      : Exposing 2 endpoint(s) beneath base path '/actuator'

```
<b>Note:</b> There might be some 'warnings' at the end. No need to be worried if you see/don't see the warnings. 

You should also see the `IP` and `OPEN PORT` `8080` information on the top.

<img src="images/WebGoat.png" width="500" />

That 8080 is a link, click on it. This should take you to a URL that looks something like:

http://ip172-18-0-38-c0u5msre75e000b69990-8080.direct.labs.play-with-docker.com

**Your exact URL will be different.**

<b>Note:</b> If you didn't see `8080` next to `OPEN PORT` on the top. like below, then click `OPEN PORT` and enter `8080`

<img src="images/no8080.png" width="500" />

<img src="images/enter8080.png" width="500" />


You **should get an error** on this page. In your browser's address bar, append **/WebGoat/** to the end of the URL and hit enter.

For example: http://ip172-18-0-12-c17317pbqvp00094kt20-8080.direct.labs.play-with-docker.com/WebGoat/

You should now see something like this:

### Step3: SQL Injection Practice

* In the left-hand menu, click on **(A1) Injection -> SQL Injection (intro)**.

    <img src="images/A1-intro.png" width="600" />

    You can start attempting these labs by completing few of the stages.

* You will get full points if you finish some of the stages in `SQL Injection (intro)`

## Submission

Do your best and complete any number of stages in `SQL Injection (intro)`, take a screenshot `yourPID.png` and submit it to Canvas `Homework 6`
